### How would you Test your algorithm?
We test every implementation of an algorithm the same way: 
1. Take an input 
2. Calculate by hand, determine your expected output 
3. Compare it to the output the algorithm

Test with various inputs to determines whether the results produced are correct
- Negative numbers. Does it still work on the list of positive numbers? 
- What about a mixed list of positive and negative numbers? 
- What about fractions? Or irrational numbers?
- Also, test forBoundary conditions, Edge Cases, Invalid Arguments

Time and Space Complexity
- Time - This area looks at the performance of the algorithm and determines how long it takes to produce its results.
- Space - This area looks at the space the algorithm occupies in storage and in memory.
