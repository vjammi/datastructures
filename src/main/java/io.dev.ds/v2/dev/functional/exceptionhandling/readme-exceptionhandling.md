### Exception Handling in Functional and Reactive Programming
- Imperative
    We tell what to do and how to do
- Declarative
    We tell what to do and NOT how to do it.
- Functional Style
    declarative style + higher order functions
- Functional Programming
    functional composition + lazy evaluation
???
    - Functional pipeline or functional composition
    - Lazy evaluation
- Reactive programming == Functional Programing++

### Exception Handling
- Fundamentally an imperative Style of Programming idea and are mutually exclusive
- An imperative style code in Java to deal with exceptions in Java

-Converting that to functional style in Java

If all is well, you keep moving no the top track
If there is a failure, you go down to the bottom track
If you recover from the failure, you are back on the top track
