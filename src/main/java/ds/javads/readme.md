## Java Collections

### Class Implementing Comparable Interface
A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object.
The class itself must implements the java.lang.Comparable interface to compare its instances.
   (1) Build a list of SportsTeam
    ```
        ArrayList<SportsTeam> list = new ArrayList<SportsTeam>();
        list.add(new SportsTeam("Team 1", 3, 2015));
        list.add(new SportsTeam("Team 2", 7, 1977));
        list.add(new SportsTeam("Team 3", 8, 1980));
        list.add(new SportsTeam("Team 4", 4, 1983));
    ```
    (2) SportsTeam implements the Comparable Interface and the associated compareTo abstract method of the Comparable interface.
    ```
        class SportsTeam implements Comparable<SportsTeam> {
            private String name;
            private int rating;
            private int year;

            // Used to sort SportsTeam by year or by rating
            public int compareTo(SportsTeam m) {
                //return this.year - m.year;
                return this.rating - m.rating;
            }
            ...
        }
    ```
    (3) Call the sort(...) method of the Collections passing the list to be sorted.
        ```Collections.sort(list);```
    (4) You now have a sorted list based on the comparator that was passed.
    ```
         for (SportsTeam sportsTeam : list)
            System.out.println(sportsTeam.getName() + " " +sportsTeam.getRating() + " " + sportsTeam.getYear());
    ```

### Comparator
Unlike Comparable, Comparator is external to the element type we are comparing. Itâ€™s a separate class. We create multiple separate classes (that implement Comparator) to compare by different members.
Collections class has a second sort() method and it takes Comparator. The sort() method invokes the compare() to sort objects.
To compare movies by Rating, we need to do 3 things :

Create a class that implements Comparator (and thus the compare() method that does the work previously done by compareTo()).
Make an instance of the Comparator class.
Call the overloaded sort() method, giving it both the list and the instance of the class that implements Comparator.

Sorting using a Comparator
    (1) Build a list of SportsTeam
    ```
        ArrayList<SportsTeam> list = new ArrayList<SportsTeam>();
        list.add(new SportsTeam("Team 1", 3, 2015));
        list.add(new SportsTeam("Team 2", 7, 1977));
        list.add(new SportsTeam("Team 3", 8, 1980));
        list.add(new SportsTeam("Team 4", 4, 1983));
    ```
    (2) Create an object of CompareByRating
    ```
         class CompareByRating implements Comparator<SportsTeam> {
             public int compare(SportsTeam m1, SportsTeam m2) {
                 if (m1.getRating() < m2.getRating()) return -1;
                 if (m1.getRating() > m2.getRating()) return 1;
                 else return 0;
             }
         }
    ```
    ```
        class CompareByStringValue implements Comparator<String> {
            public int compare(String str1, String str2) {
                return str1.compareTo(str2);
            }
        }

        class CompareByStringValueAt implements Comparator<String> {
            public int compare(String str1, String str2) {
                if (str1.charAt(5) < str2.charAt(5)) return -1;
                else if (str1.charAt(5) > str2.charAt(5)) return 1;
                else return 0;
            }
        }
    ```
    (3) Call the sort(...) method of the Collections passing the list to be sorted and the associated comparator.
        ```Collections.sort(list, compareByRating);```
    (4) You now have a sorted list based on the comparator that was passed.
    ```
         for (SportsTeam sportsTeam : list)
            System.out.println(sportsTeam.getName() + " " +sportsTeam.getRating() + " " + sportsTeam.getYear());
    ```
