## Complexity Analysis

### Binary Tree - DFS
Time Complexity : O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the binary tree.
Space Complexity : O(N). In the worst case space utilized by the recursion stack would be N, since the height of a skewed binary tree could be N. 
                   Can also be said as O(depth) = O(log N) to keep the recursion stack, where d is a tree depth.

### Binary Tree - BFS
Let N be the total number of nodes in the input tree.
Time Complexity: O(N)
We visit each node once and only once. And at each visit, it takes a constant time to process.
Space Complexity: O(N)
We used a queue to maintain the nodes along with its indices, which is the main memory consumption of the algorithm.
Due to the nature of BFS, at any given moment, the queue holds no more than two levels of nodes. In the worst case,
a level in a full binary tree contains at most half of the total nodes (i.e. N/2â€‹), i.e. this is also the
level where the leaf nodes reside. Hence, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is O(N).
	
### HashMap - Space Complexity 
Storing N strings of max length K in a HashMap 
O(N*K)

### Arrays 
Storing N strings, each in an Array of 26 char length [each array being a charset of 26 chars long]
O(N*A) - Length of A is 26
