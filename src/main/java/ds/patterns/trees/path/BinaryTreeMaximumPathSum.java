/**
    124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
    A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting
    them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
    The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

    Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.
    Remember that in your recursive function, you almost always have to do something with the current node's value.
    Combining or modifying it w3ith the solution from its children.
    You need to know how to combine those intermediate solutions into the current solution and you need to pass it back up
    the recursive tree stack, and the cycle repeats itself.

    Input: root = [1,2,3]
            1
        2       3

    Output: 6
    Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

    Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    Output: 42
    Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

    Intuition
                -10

        9                   20      //return currentNode + its left segment or it right seg, which ever is positive

                  15(Left)      7(Right)

    First we get the max sum paths from left and right subtrees
    If either of them are negative, then we are better off not using them at all, in other words we either take a 0 or a positive sum.
    Next we find the max path sum that can be formed including our current node.

     If we have negative on the above node, we need to see if bringing the -ve node would outweigh the sum from the other side of the tree.
     To connect with the parent [10] we cannot use the two paths of the subtree [15-20-7].
     We need to choose either 20-15 or 20-7.

     How do we account for these ?
         We need to bring the largest path segment from the left and right subtrees.
         then we connect them by adding the current node.
         The parent should ignore if there is a -ve value coming out of the subtree.

         First we get the max sum paths from left and right subtrees
         If either of them are negative, then we are better off not using them at all, in other words we either take a 0 or a positive sum.
