### How would you Test your algorithm?
You test every implementation of an algorithm the same way: 
    take an input, 
    calculate by hand your expected output, and 
    compare it to the output the algorithm provides you.

Test with various inputs - negative numbers. Does it still work on the list of positive numbers? What about a mixed list of positive and negative numbers? What about fractions? Or irrational numbers?

Verification - This area looks at the process the algorithm uses. In other words, it analyzes the steps the algorithm uses and determines if they are correct.
Validation - This area looks at the outputs of the algorithm and determines whether the results produced are correct.

Time - This area looks at the performance of the algorithm and determines how long it takes to produce its results.
Space - This area looks at the space the algorithm occupies in storage and in memory. 
        This is of particular interest when the target device is resource constrained.
