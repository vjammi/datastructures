        Problem:
            Find the sum of the first N numbers.
        Objective function:
            f(i) is the sum of the first i elements.
        Recurrence relation:
            f(n) = f(n-1) + n

         // dp[1] = dp[1-1] + 1
         // dp[2] = dp[2-1] + 2
         // dp[3] = dp[3-1] + 2
        we created an array of size n+1 and used it as a cache the sum of the previous sub problem
        We cached the intermediate results in an array
        Result in the last element
        for n = 5 we will create an array of 6 elements
            [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
        In Dynamic programming, we do not want to re-calculte things
            for n = 5 the sum is 15
            so for n = 6 is n[5] + 6
        This is called memoization. we cache the results of a computation so that we can resuse later.
        We optimize the time complexity by giving up space.
        Its a time / memory tradeoff
