/**
 * 362. Design Hit Counter
 * Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes (i.e., the past 300 seconds).
 * Your system should accept a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity), and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., timestamp is monotonically increasing). Several hits may arrive roughly at the same time.

 * Implement the HitCounter class:
 * HitCounter() Initializes the object of the hit counter system.
 * void hit(int timestamp) Records a hit that happened at timestamp (in seconds). Several hits may happen at the same timestamp.
 * int getHits(int timestamp) Returns the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from timestamp (i.e., the past 300 seconds).
 * Example 1:
 * Input
 * ["HitCounter", "hit", "hit", "hit", "getHits", "hit", "getHits", "getHits"]
 * [[], [1], [2], [3], [4], [300], [300], [301]]
 * Output
 * [null, null, null, null, 3, null, 4, 3]
 *
 * Explanation
 * HitCounter hitCounter = new HitCounter();
 * hitCounter.hit(1);       // hit at timestamp 1.
 * hitCounter.hit(2);       // hit at timestamp 2.
 * hitCounter.hit(3);       // hit at timestamp 3.
 * hitCounter.getHits(4);   // get hits at timestamp 4, return 3.
 * hitCounter.hit(300);     // hit at timestamp 300.
 * hitCounter.getHits(300); // get hits at timestamp 300, return 4.
 * hitCounter.getHits(301); // get hits at timestamp 301, return 3.
 *
 * Approach #1: Using Queue
 * Intuition
 * A key observation here is that all the timestamps that we will encounter are going to be in increasing order. Also as the timestamps' value increases we have to ignore the timestamps that occurred previously (having a difference of 300 or more with the latest timestamp). This is the case of considering the elements in the FIFO manner (First in first out) which is best solved by using the "queue" data structure.
 *
 * Algorithm
 * We will add each timestamp to the queue in the hit method and will remove all the timestamps with difference greater than or equal to 300 from the queue inside getHits. The answer returned from the getHits method is then simply the size of the queue.
