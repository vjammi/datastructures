/**
    You have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
    You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
    Return true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.

        Example 1:
        Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]
        Output: true

        Example 2:
        Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,4]]
        Output: false

    Constraints:
         1 <= 2000 <= n
         0 <= edges.length <= 5000
         edges[i].length == 2
         0 <= ai, bi < n
         ai != bi
         There are no self-loops or repeated edges.

    Solution
     Approach 1: Graph Theory + Iterative Depth-First Search

     Intuition
     Note that this same approach also works with recursive depth-first search and iterative breadth-first search. We'll look at these briefly in the Algorithm section.
     Recall that a graph, G, is a tree iff the following two conditions are met:

     G is fully connected. In other words, for every pair of nodes in G, there is a path between them.
     G contains no cycles. In other words, there is exactly one path between each pair of nodes in G.
     Depth-first search is a classic graph-traversal algorithm that can be used to check for both of these conditions:

     G is fully connected if, and only if, we started a depth-first search from a single source and discovered all nodes in G during it.
     G contains no cycles if, and only if, the depth-first search never goes back to an already discovered node. We need to be careful though not to count trivial cycles of the form A → B → A that occur with most implementations of undirected edges.
     Depth-first search requires being able to look up the adjacent (immediate neighbours) of a given node. Like many graph interview problems though, the input format we're given doesn't allow us to quickly get the neighbours of a node. Therefore, our first step is to convert the input into an adjacency list. Recall that an adjacency list is where we have a list of sub-lists, where each sub-list is the list of the immediate neighbours for the i'th node.
