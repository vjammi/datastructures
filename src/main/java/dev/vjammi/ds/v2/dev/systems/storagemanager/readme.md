## Slotted page Database Storage Manager

A slotted page database Storage Manager is responsible for managing the storage of data in a database. It stores data in
fixed-size pages, called slots, and each page contains a fixed number of slots. In Java, you can implement a slotted
pages database Storage Manager by following these general steps:

1. Define a page size: The first step is to define the page size in bytes. A page size is the number of bytes per page,
   and it should be a multiple of the slot size.

2. Define a slot size: The second step is to define the slot size in bytes. A slot size is the number of bytes per slot,
   and it should be a multiple of the byte size.

3. Create a Page class: The Page class represents a single page in the storage manager. The Page class should have the
   following properties:

- An array of bytes to store the data.
- A list of empty slots.
- A pointer to the next free slot.

4. Create a Slot class: The Slot class represents a single slot in the storage manager. The Slot class should have the
   following properties:

- An ID to identify the slot.
- A flag to indicate whether the slot is free or not.
- The offset of the slot within the page.

5. Create a StorageManager class: The StorageManager class is responsible for managing the pages and slots. It should
   have the following methods:

- createPage(): This method creates a new page and returns its page ID. getPage(pageID): This method retrieves the page
  with the specified page ID.
- getSlot(slotID): This method retrieves the slot with the specified slot ID.
- insertRecord(record): This method inserts a new record into the database.
- deleteRecord(recordID): This method deletes a record from the database.
- updateRecord(recordID, record): This method updates a record in the database.

6. Create a Record class: The Record class represents a single record in the database. The Record class should have the
   following properties:

- A unique ID to identify the record.
- The data associated with the record.

7. Implement the StorageManager class: The StorageManager class should use the Page and Slot classes to manage the
   storage of data in the database. The insertRecord(), deleteRecord(), and updateRecord() methods should use the Slot
   and Record classes to manage the data in the database.

8. Test the StorageManager class: Finally, you should test the StorageManager class to ensure that it works as expected.

Note that this is a high-level overview of how to implement a slotted pages database Storage Manager in Java, and the
actual implementation details will depend on your specific requirements and the database system you are building.
